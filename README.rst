--------
The following settings can be changed by adding to your project's settings.py file:

1. Override the default cache duration for Named Menus, default = 3600 seconds

.. code::

  CMS_NAMED_MENUS_CACHE_DURATION = 3600


2. Set the application namespaces that can be used with Named Menus as a list, default is CMS pages only - as the page id will not be unique for other applications e.g. Aldryn NewsBlog etc. default = ['CMSMenu',]

or to allow all namespaces:

.. code::
